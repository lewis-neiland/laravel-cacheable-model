# Easy Cacheable Models for Laravel (for ```file``` driver)

This is a solution to cache then manage Eloquent models and their relationships in a consistent manner, using the default ```file``` driver.
Initially created for an earlier project, so that we could easily implement caching in our preestablished systems.

**Does not support caching tables that do not have a Model.**

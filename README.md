# Easy Cacheable Models for Laravel (for ```file``` driver)

This is a simple solution to streamline using the Cache facade with Eloquent models and their relationships; In particular with using the default ```file``` driver.
Initially created for an earlier project, so that we could easily implement caching in our preestablished systems.


**Does not support caching tables that do not have a Model.**
